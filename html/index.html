<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
<h2>Steffen S. Martinsen</h2>
<p>There is no functionality at the root level, please see one of the following endpoints:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://prog2005-cloud.onrender.com/librarystats/v1/bookcount/?language=">Bookcount</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://prog2005-cloud.onrender.com/librarystats/v1/readership/">Readership</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://prog2005-cloud.onrender.com/librarystats/v1/status">Status</a></li>
</ul>
<h1>Documentation:</h1>
<p>The assignment creates an API that communicates with several APIs to retrieve information.
    The information varies on the endpoint provided in the URL by the user.
    <br>The service queries the Gutenberg Library, REST Countries, Language2Country APIs (self hosted).
    There are three endpoints that supply the user with different information,
    and can itself take parameters or further endpoints.
    These endpoints are bookcountHandler, readershipHandler, and statusHandler. <br></p>

<p>
    The creation of the unique author slice for both bookcountHandlerand readershipHandler
    attempts to reduce response time by utilizing go routines.
    <br>However, the query to languages with a large amount of books is still very slow.
</p>
<h2>Bookcount</h2>
<p>
    Bookhandler recieves an url in the form of <b>https://prog2005-cloud.onrender.com/librarystats/v1/bookhcount/?language={ISO_Code}</b>
    <br>The <i>{ISO_Code}</i> of the parameter can be any 2-letter ISO code for a country.
    It extracts this information and queries the Gutenberg Library API to find the relevant information
    for this language.
    <br>
    If the URL provided does not contain a parameter it throws an error asking for a language. The same
    message is provided if we are at the root <i>bookcount/</i> and if the parameters are empty like <i>bookcount/?language=</i>
    <br>
    The endpoint only hanldes GET requests and will provide a message to the client if the request is of another method.
    The endpoint will read from the Gutenberg library and provide the amoount of books in a given language,<br>
    how many unique authors have authored the books, and the fraction of books of the given language of the total amount of books.
    <br>
</p>
<h2>Readership</h2>
<p>
    Readership recieves an URL in the form of <b>https://prog2005-cloud.onrender.com/librarystats/v1/readership/{ISO_code}/?{limit}</b>
    <br>The <i>{ISO_Code}</i> is a 2-letter ISO Code for a given country. The <i>{limit}</i> is an optional parameter that can be used to limit the amount of countries returned.
    <br>If the <i>{ISO_Code}</i> is empty the server will throw an error and ask for a country code from the client.
    <i>{limit}</i> may be empty, and the server will supply the amount of countries it found for that language.
    <br>The server queries the Gutenberg Library like the <b>bookcount endpoint</b> and provides the same information of
    the number of books and authors for a given language. Additionally, it queries the Language2Country API to find
    the number of countries where the given ISO_Code language is an official language.
    <br>
    It then queries the REST Countries API and returns the population of the countries it finds individually to the client,
    and assumes this is the potential readership of books in this language.
</p>
<h2>Status</h2>
<p>
    The status endpoint resides at the url address: <b>https://prog2005-cloud.onrender.com/librarystats/v1/status/</b>
    Statushandler retrieves the status codes from all the APIs the service relies on, along with the version and the uptime of the service.
    <br>The errors in the endpoint are of log.Fatal so the program moves on. If there are errors on the GET requests
    we want to return the error message to the client and not return to the client because something failed.
